# kino v1.0

Project 'kino'.

'kino' is simple example of cinema web service.
It implements my simple reservation system and my simple CMS for administrators of 'kino' (adding and editing films, adding and deleting admins).
Technologies used in project: php, mysql and bootstrap.
Maybe it doesn't look good but it works. 
I know that is not perfect but I am only a beginner.
